This repo serves as an Angular Starter Blueprint for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular and TypeScript fast. 

- Best practices in file and application organization for Angular.
- Pre included state of the art libraries
- A great Angular seed repo for anyone who wants to start their project.
- Ahead of Time (AoT) compile for rapid page loads of your production builds.
- Tree shaking to automatically remove unused code from your production bundle.

### Environment Management
One of the most important part of the repository is the environment management. 
Environment management is done via the environment files and the Network Manager.

> All APIs are to be listed in [environment.xxx.ts]()

##### API Calling
In your component use this -
```typescript
const payload = {};
this.service.parseEnv('url_key', 'POST', payload).subscribe((val) => {
            // Handle Valid Response Here
        }, (err) => {
            // Handle Error Response Here(eg. 500)
        })
```

> The 'url_key' must be defined in the [environment.xxx.ts]() files. That's it. 
No other modifications are required.


### Designing Modules
The modules should comprise of at most 2-3 big components. If you require more components 
group them together and register them in a separate module. How to load them is described below-


##### Loading Modules
> Url Based Modules

These modules have to be lazily loaded via url routes.

> Feature Based Modules

The components defined here can simply be imported into another module via an import where it
is required.

##### Shared Module
The shared module contains the following components, services and functionalities. The components 
have been designed as modules for easier import into modules wherever they are required.

- Directives
- Components
- Models
- Services
- Stylesheets

> Directives

| Directive         | Description   | Usage  |
| -------------     |---------------| -------|
| Contenteditable   | This is to create dynamic containers with variable height | ```<div [appContentEditableModel]="ngmodel_variable" (appContentEditableModelChange)="change($event)"></div>``` |

> For components, see below

### Global Components
These components have been designed and created so as to be flexible enough to accomodate various
scenarios without imposing any king of restrictions from customising it. 

> Important: Please note that to use these you have to import the shared/components/<component_name> module
to the required module


##### Global Reusable Components

> Loader
